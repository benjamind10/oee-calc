# Production OEE Calculator

This is a command-line tool written in Python to calculate Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and its components: **Availability**, **Performance**, and **Quality**. You can also calculate OEE directly by multiplying these percentages together.

## Features

- **Availability**: Calculates the ratio of productive time to planned production time.
- **Performance**: Calculates the ratio of actual production to ideal production based on production data.
- **Quality**: Calculates the ratio of good parts to total parts produced.
- **OEE**: Computes Overall Equipment Effectiveness by multiplying Availability, Performance, and Quality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional external libraries are needed since the script uses Python's built-in modules.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (or copy the script to your local machine):

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd oee_calculator
   ```
